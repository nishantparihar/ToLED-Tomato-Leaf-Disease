# Machine-Learning-Project
This is a project which is based on CNN & VGG16 (Which is a deep learning algorithm). The dataset which is used in this project was from the Kaggle site named as a plant-village dataset which has the data of various crops among all these data, the tomato leaf dataset was used for this project. The CNN algorithm is in the tomato_disease_training.pynb and there is a separate file for the VGG16 algorithm and its implementation. This project detects the faulty leaves from tomato trees so that plants can be treated accordingly as 9 types of diseases can happen to tomato leaves and by doing all these steps, the yield of the crop can be increased which will impact our overall tomato production and we will get healthy and good tomatoes to eat, the accuracy of this project is 96%.(approx)
